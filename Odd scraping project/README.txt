Hello everyone!

For educational purposes, I tried building a simple bet scraper using Python to explore how data can be extracted from websites in real-time, and using mathematical knowledge to exploit the different odds and make **potentially* money. The goal of this project was to learn more about web scraping techniques, HTTP requests, parsing tools like BeautifulSoup or Selenium, and how odds data is structured online, while also **potentially** benefiting financially from this project.

However, not all of the files and components of the scraper are included in this repository. This is because scraping betting websites may violate their terms of service and raise legal and ethical concerns. To avoid any misuse or misunderstanding, Iâ€™ve intentionally left out parts of the code.

This project is **strictly for educational use only**, and should not be used for any commercial or unauthorized data scraping.

Thanks for understanding!
